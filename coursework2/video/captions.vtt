WEBVTT - Murder Mystery Backstory

00:01.480 --> 00:02.870
Sorry to bother you Detective,

00:02.863 --> 00:04.013
but we have a new case for you.

00:04.490 --> 00:06.830
You are informed that there has been a suspected murder

00:07.100 --> 00:08.315
at the wealthy Lord Roland

00:08.318 --> 00:11.578
Hawthorne’s birthday party, at his home. 


00:11.707 --> 00:13.707
The apparent cause of death is poison.

00:14.176 --> 00:17.266
You head to the location specified in the phone call

00:17.265 --> 00:19.405
and as you make your way up the driveway,

00:19.407 --> 00:21.312
you notice the well kept grounds with an array of plants.

00:21.596 --> 00:22.781
You get to the door and

00:22.790 --> 00:24.510
you are greeted by the Butler.

00:24.530 --> 00:27.880
The butler takes you to the study, where you find Lord Hawthorne’s body.

00:27.883 --> 00:31.893
You examine the body closer. There are no signs of traumatic injury.


00:32.355 --> 00:34.635
You check the glass of half drunk whiskey. 


00:34.666 --> 00:38.056
There’s a smell you recognise, but can’t quite put your finger on.

00:38.660 --> 00:41.020
You do however notice a pendant on the floor,

00:41.853 --> 00:43.853
perhaps from a necklace or bracelet.

00:44.470 --> 00:47.710
You follow the butler out of the study and into the living room.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.399
You find the party guests.

00:49.412 --> 00:50.802
All 3 of them.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.765
Lord Hawthorne was a bit of a recluse you see, 


00:53.009 --> 00:55.144
so only a few people were invited.

00:55.814 --> 00:57.274
This is Lady Clarissa Hawthorne. 

00:57.388 --> 01:00.858
The loving, if not slightly young, second wife of Lord Hawthorne.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.830
This is Alistair Hawthorne. Son of Lord Hawthorne and his first wife, Elizabeth. 

01:06.077 --> 01:08.077
He is often away at boarding school.

01:08.426 --> 01:10.586
And finally, this is Doctor William Medicus. 

01:10.713 --> 01:13.363
Long time friend and family doctor for the Hawthorne’s.
